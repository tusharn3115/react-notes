- React nai hme ik syntax diya hai, ki ik function lo usmai html return krodo or react us function ke under return kiya gya html tags and all ko render krwa dega

- now if you will try to pass 2 tags in the function in react it will give us and error because in react we can only pass one tags, so react said you can inclose the other tags into a <div> tag but it was a common problem in react inclosing tags into div again and again, so react allow us to enclose these tags into a empty tag also called fragment.

Eg:- 
function App(){  
    return(
        <>  ----> this empty tag is called fragment
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <p>Paragraph</p>
        ...and other tags
        </>
    )
}

- The name of the function's first letter should be capital else the code will give us an error

--- Custom Render 

* hmne custom_react folder mai sikne ki koshish kri ki react kese elements ko create krta hai
1. hmne ik mainContainer bnaya jismai querySelector se tag ko uthaya where we will inject the code 

2. hmne ik khud ka customRender bnaya jismai we select mainContainer and reactElement 

3. reactElement object mai hmne anpa syntax define kna ki phele tag ayega then attributes and then text

4. then hmne customRender function mai sabhi tags, attribute and text ko import and set krna 

5. then customRender mai arguments pass kreke browser per render krwaya

- then hmne dekha ki app.jsx sirf ik method hai toh kya hm main.jsx mai method likh skte hai, and yes we ca write methods in main.jsx and can render it 

- hmne dekha ki hm jo methods bnate hai and react us method ko tree structure/ object bnati hai or usko inject krti hai

- to hm apna element jo bhi toh inject krskte hai but it was not working 

- but then we create a variable and usmai pura HTML pass krta hu then it works this mean khud ki bnai key react nhi smjhta its has set ot rules and syntax to follow 

- to create an element react gives us React.createElement() method which is by default injected by transpiler called Babel

- so here we see how to create a react element in which first parameter is expected a html tag, second param is object and third is direct text and the last comes the variable injections




// Hooks -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features

- one of the hooks is useState()

- this hook is resposible for changing state and these changes are propogated into our UI or DOM

- useState give us two things in form of an array first is counter(can be name as per needed) and second is function






// Understanding createRoot() method ------------------------------------------------------------------

- createRoot() method behind the scene create a DOM like structure just like our browser have a DOM

- now why it needs to create another DOM of it self, its because it compares the React DOM and the Browser DOM and update only those things which are updated in the UI

- but what browser does is, it remove the whole DOM tree and create a new DOM with the updates in the UI, thats why our page reloads


VIRTUAL DOM - what virtual DOM does is, with its help we can keep track of our whole virtual DOM in tree like structure and only those value which are changes are only removed and is updated not the entire DOM
